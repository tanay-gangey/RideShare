0] Add ResponseQ
1] Create one Dockerfile & docker-compose.yml - containing structure for a single worker
    - This would spawn a new worker (whether master/slave doesn't matter; same code)
2] Test endpoints on instance - expecting errors
    - We are not returning headers from read/write db, so check if it still works
    - Fix if it doesn't
3] Write code to spawn worker automatically based on no. of requests
4] Fix crash APIs

EOD: Remove unncecessary files/directories, clean repo.
